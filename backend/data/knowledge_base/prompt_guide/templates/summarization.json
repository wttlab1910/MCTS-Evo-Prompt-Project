      "input": "The study found that participants who exercised regularly showed improved cognitive function compared to the control group. Specifically, those who engaged in at least 150 minutes of moderate exercise per week demonstrated enhanced memory recall and problem-solving abilities. The researchers noted that the benefits were most pronounced in adults over 65 years of age. Additionally, the type of exercise seemed to matter less than the consistency and duration of physical activity. This research adds to the growing body of evidence suggesting that regular physical exercise may help prevent cognitive decline in aging populations.",
