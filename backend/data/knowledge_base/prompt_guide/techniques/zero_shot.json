Researchers found that moderate caffeine consumption (200-300mg) improved reaction time and short-term memory. However, they also noted that doses exceeding 400mg produced diminishing returns and increased anxiety in some participants. The study concluded that the optimal cognitive benefits occur at different dosages depending on individual factors such as body weight and caffeine tolerance.",

    "Be clear and specific about the task",
    "Specify the expected output format", 
    "Include relevant constraints or considerations",
    "Structure the prompt with clear separation between instructions and input data",
